// Property Access

// Q. What is Property Access?
// - It is use to access character from string like we are accessing element from array.

// NOTE
// - It's look like we are accessing element from array but it's not.
// - If no character is found [] return undefine.
// - It's read only you can't add character in string like we do in array str[0] = A (This won't give you the error but it will not work.)

// SYNTAX
// string[indexNumber]

let str = "Hello world";
console.log(str[3]);
